# Adaptive-Depth U-Net Project Overview

This repository hosts two related pipelines:

- **Super_resolution/** – end-to-end tooling for single-image super-resolution (TensorFlow/Keras).
- **Segmenation/** – semantic segmentation workflow (TODO documentation).

Detailed instructions for super-resolution live in `Super_resolution/README.md` (dataset paths, environment setup, training/evaluation commands, visualization tools, and troubleshooting). Refer to that file for day-to-day usage.

> Segmentation docs: **TODO** (to be written once the pipeline is finalised).
